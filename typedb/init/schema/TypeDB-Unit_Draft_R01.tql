## Example Usage
match
$h isa house, has footprint $fp;
$fp > 1200;
(magnitude: $fp, units: $u) isa quantity;
$u has name "square feet";
# alternatively $u has symbol "ftÂ²"


# TODO:
#   - dimensionless quantity
#   - finish tolerance
#   - handling of affine unit conversion?
#   - haneling of logarithmic unit conversion?
#   - add more semantics like LaTeX, descriptions, references, etc.?
